objectives:
  - gain insight into the relational module (implementation of etam-esque optimization) from patacchiola&storkey 2020 by tracing relation decisions on a graph
  - improve training and model performance by leveraging spectral properties of the relational graph
  - compare against http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/bianchi20a/bianchi20a.pdf

tests:
  - MiniBatch
    * list structure  -> PASS
    * set identity    -> PASS
  - aggregation
    * nb samples      -> FAIL
    * label accuracy  -> PASS
  - augmentation (scipy)
    * visual check    -> good
      - ColorJitter   -> good
    * channel sensitivity -> PASS
